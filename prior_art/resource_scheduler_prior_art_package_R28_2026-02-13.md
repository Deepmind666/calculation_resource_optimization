## 2. What Is Improved in R28

1. Added non-patent literature matrix (CN/Wanfang oriented) with traceable URLs.
2. Added engineering legal-status archival package for CN-RS-01/04/06.
3. Linked these artifacts into the prior-art package path for reviewer/counsel handoff.

## 3. Current Closure View

Substantially closed (engineering level):
1. RS-P01 claim-level risk baseline.
2. CN top-3 claim-level engineering comparison.
3. Non-patent literature pass (first round matrix).
4. CN legal-status engineering archive.

Not fully closed (legal filing level):
1. CNIPA official screenshot/export archive package.
2. Counsel-reviewed legal claim charts.
3. CNKI direct entry archival snapshots (query + result pages).

## 4. Reviewer Fast Checklist

1. Confirm every URL resolves and matches described source type.
2. Check that risk labels align with overlap descriptions.
3. Ensure unresolved legal-grade items are still explicitly tracked.
4. Verify no claim of "final legal closure" is made.
