# Resource Scheduler Prior-Art Package (R26)

- Timestamp: 2026-02-13 15:52:00 +08:00
- Owner: Codex (GPT-5)
- Purpose: one-stop review package for external strict review / counsel handoff

## 1. Package Scope

This package targets resource-scheduler patent-risk and claim-differentiation evidence for the current project direction.

## 2. Read Order (strict)

1. `prior_art/resource_scheduler_prior_art_index_v2_2026-02-13.md`
2. `prior_art/resource_scheduler_claim_level_RS-P01_v2_2026-02-13.md`
3. `prior_art/resource_scheduler_claim_level_CN_top3_2026-02-13.md`
4. `prior_art/resource_scheduler_cnipa_search_log_2026-02-13.md`
5. `prior_art/resource_scheduler_cnipa_legal_status_appendix_2026-02-13.md`
6. `qa/technique_claim_mapping_resource_scheduler_v2_2026-02-13.md`

## 3. What Is Substantially Closed

1. RS-P01 family is explicitly treated as High risk with independent-claim-level engineering comparison.
2. CN candidate set is expanded and top-3 CN claim-level engineering chart is available.
3. Prior-art navigation and review path are synchronized in one index.

## 4. What Is Not Closed (must stay explicit)

1. Official CNIPA legal-status archival snapshots are not yet packaged.
2. Counsel-reviewed legal claim charts are not yet available.
3. CNKI/Wanfang non-patent pass is not yet included.

## 5. Review Checklist for External Auditor

1. Verify every cited patent URL resolves and matches described domain.
2. Check risk labels are consistent with claim overlap descriptions.
3. Confirm independent-claim abstractions are structurally complete.
4. Confirm differentiation claims map to actual code/tests/evidence artifacts.
5. Confirm unresolved items are explicitly tracked (no fake closure).

## 6. Suggested Next Action Bundle (R27)

1. Archive CNIPA legal-status evidence screenshots/exports for CN-RS-01/04/06.
2. Add CNKI/Wanfang references (>=5) and overlap-difference matrix.
3. Produce counsel-facing legal claim-chart template from engineering chart.
