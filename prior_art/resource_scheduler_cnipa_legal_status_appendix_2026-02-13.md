- Purpose: provide auditable status snapshot for top CN candidates
- Note: this appendix records public status signals and required follow-up; it is not a legal opinion.

## 1. Status Snapshot Table

| ID | Patent | URL | Observed status signal (2026-02-13) | Engineering interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CN-RS-01 | CN117788264A | https://patents.google.com/patent/CN117788264A/en | "Application ... published" (legal status not active grant) | Pending/publication stage candidate |
| CN-RS-04 | CN111736987B | https://patents.google.com/patent/CN111736987B/zh | "Active" | Granted/active candidate with stronger legal weight |
| CN-RS-06 | CN116719628B | https://patents.google.com/patent/CN116719628B/zh | "Active" | Granted/active candidate with stronger legal weight |

## 2. CNIPA Official Entry Points (for legal-grade verification)

1. Search portal: https://pss-system.cponline.cnipa.gov.cn/conventionalSearch
2. Portal instruction page: https://www.cnipa.gov.cn/art/2023/2/13/art_3166_182074.html
3. Public service guide: https://www.cnipa.gov.cn/art/2024/4/1/art_3359_191346.html

## 3. Required Follow-Up to Fully Close ISSUE-51

1. Export official legal-status records for CN-RS-01/04/06 from CNIPA workflow.
2. Attach evidence snapshots (query conditions + result page metadata) to prior-art package.
3. Confirm grant/publication/legal events with publication numbers and date stamps in one consolidated table.

## 4. Risk Implication

1. CN-RS-04 and CN-RS-06 are active and must be treated as higher-priority legal comparison targets than publication-only candidates.
2. CN-RS-01 remains relevant but should be handled as a pending/publication candidate in risk ranking.
3. Final filing draft should keep claim language centered on integrated combination mechanics, not generic preemption wording.
